# ImageClassifier
This is for building an image classifier for my data mining class. 
The goal is to improve the average accuracy of classification by experimenting with different hyper parameters. 
I will then build a model that will classify specifically Motorbikes, Airplanes, and Schooners.

By uncommenting each section of the code you will see there different experiments performed
All data was graphed and recorded personally on excel
